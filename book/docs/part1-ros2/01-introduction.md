# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the exciting world of Physical AI, where the digital intelligence of algorithms meets the tangible reality of the physical world. This book is your guide to transitioning from the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs) and pure data to the dynamic field of humanoid robotics.

Throughout this journey, we will explore the four foundational pillars that allow a robot to perceive, act, and learn in our world:

1.  **The Nervous System (ROS 2)**: How different parts of a robot communicate.
2.  **The Digital Twin (Simulation)**: How we create virtual worlds to safely test and train our robots.
3.  **The AI Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: How we use powerful AI and perception algorithms to make sense of the world.
4.  **Cognitive Planning (VLMs)**: How robots can understand and act on high-level, human-like instructions.

Let's begin.
