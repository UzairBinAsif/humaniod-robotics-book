# Autonomous Navigation with Nav2

Once a robot can build a map of its environment (using a SLAM algorithm like the one provided by Isaac ROS), the next step is to enable it to navigate autonomously. In the ROS 2 ecosystem, the **Nav2** project is the state-of-the-art solution for mobile robot navigation.

Nav2 is a complete navigation stack that takes a goal pose (an `(x, y, theta)` coordinate) and computes a safe path to get there, generates velocity commands, and avoids obstacles along the way.

## Core Components of Nav2

Nav2 is composed of several key servers that work together:

-   **Controller Server**: Generates velocity commands (`cmd_vel`) to follow the global path. It uses algorithms like DWB (Dynamic Window Approach) or TEB (Timed Elastic Band) to handle local obstacle avoidance.
-   **Planner Server**: Creates a global path from the robot's current position to the goal. It typically uses algorithms like A* or Dijkstra.
-   **Behavior Server**: Manages high-level navigation behaviors like spinning to recover from an error or waiting for a specific condition.
-   **Smoother Server**: Can be used to smooth out a path generated by the planner to make it more suitable for a robot to follow.
-   **Waypoint Follower**: Allows you to provide a sequence of waypoints for the robot to follow in order.

## The Costmap

Central to Nav2's operation is the **costmap**, a 2D or 3D grid that represents the "cost" of traversing any part of the environment.

-   **Obstacles**: Cells containing obstacles (from sensor data) have a high cost (or are marked as lethal).
-   **Inflation Layer**: An inflation radius is added around obstacles to create a buffer zone, encouraging the robot to stay a safe distance away.
-   **Path Planning**: The planner uses the costmap to find the lowest-cost path from the start to the goal.

Nav2 uses two main costmaps:
1.  **Global Costmap**: Used by the planner to create a long-range path across the entire known map.
2.  **Local Costmap**: A smaller, rolling window around the robot used by the controller for local obstacle avoidance and path adjustments.

By integrating the output of a SLAM system with Nav2, we can achieve fully autonomous navigation: the robot builds a map and then uses that map to navigate to any desired point.
